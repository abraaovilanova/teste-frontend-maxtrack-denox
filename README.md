## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to assess my knowledge and experience with ReactJS and related libraries for front-end developer.


## API
For the BackeEnd the public API was used [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

## Test
You must create a filter to search for films, series or artists. After the search, you should display the photo of the filtered item and the name in poster format, with the description of the film.
Clicking on the poster should display the description about the item:
* Film : release date and evaluation
